1. Elvina, dear friend, come, give me your hand,
2. I fade, stop the heavy sleep of life;
3. Tell me ... will I see, for a long parting
4. Am I condemned by fate?
5. Will she never look at a friend?
6. Are my days covered with eternal darkness?
7. Will the morning never catch us
8. In the arms of love?
9. Elvina! Why in the late hours of the night
10. I cannot hug you with delight,
11. Eyes are full of longing for a sweetheart
12. And tremble with passion?
13. And in dumb joy, in the bliss of pleasure
14. Your whisper sweet and quiet moan to listen,
15. And quietly in humble darkness for the bliss of awakening
16. To fall asleep near the darling?
